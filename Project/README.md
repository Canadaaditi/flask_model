# Project Name: ML Model Deployment Website

This project deploys machine learning models for the Ames Housing dataset and the Titanic dataset through a Flask web application. The website allows users to explore the datasets, view model descriptions, and make predictions using their own data.

## Overview

The project consists of a Flask web application that serves as the interface for users to interact with the deployed machine learning models. It includes pages for the Welcome message, About pages for each dataset, and prediction pages for each machine learning model.

## Usage

To use the project, users need to have Python installed on their machine. They can clone the repository, install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the Flask application. Once the application is running, users can access it through their web browser.
